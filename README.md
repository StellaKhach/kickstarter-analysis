# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview of Project
  The purpose of this assignment was to create pivot tables and pivot charts based on the data provided. The "kickstarter" sheet is where the master data is lovated, from which we filter and create the other sheets on the document. The project was designed to find specific patters in the specified categories and other filters. The purpose of this analysis was to be able to use finctions such as "CountIfs", "VLookUp", "Average","Median", etc. We also used the "save as image" functions to submit pictures of the graphs/charts that we made.
  
Analysis and Challenges
    The first deliverable was slightly easier to perform than the second. In that analysis, I inserted a pivot table into a new sheet and changed the title to "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". The second step was to pull up the "field list" and drag the fields to the right areas. Because we want the mail filters to be the parent category and the years, we drag those to the "Filters" tab. Second, we want the columns to be the outcome possibilities, so we drag those there. Then we set the rows to be the "date created" and the values to be the count of the outcomes. I then inserter a stacked line graph and titled it "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and saved it as a ".png" file. In the worksheet titled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date", there were a few challenges that were encountered. The first one, was having the months displayed in the "Row Labels" section instead of the years. The solution to this problem was to take out the "quarters" tab that was auto-populated in the "fields" list. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92186586/171545366-a3503667-2b8d-462f-8e74-f18dc4746765.png)


    The second deliverable was slightly more complex. I created a table with 12 rows and 8 columns. With the use of COUNTIFS and SUM, I was able to come up with the solution to most of the columns. Once this was completed, we then had to turn this into a stacked line chart.The challenge in this exercise was using the COUNTIFS function. Because the function has so many arguments, it is easy to mess up on some of the data. The formula that I used had 3 separate categories, which was a filter of Success/Fail/Canceled, category of plays, and the goal number within the specified range. The second challenge faced was the actual graph. The axis were not alligned correctly and the chart would only show half of the data. I found it easier to do separate graphs and then paste and combine them int one single graph. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92186586/171545376-a9014e80-5a72-4065-aa0b-821e4fcb525c.png) 

    
Results 
    In the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date, there is a peak in both success and failure of theater in the month of May followed by April and June. The success is much more than the failure at about 50% higher success than failure during those few months. This shows that although those months have the highest months of failure, the success rate is much higher. In the "canceled" category, we see that during October there are no cancelations in the theater category. The cancelations overall and very less compared to the failures and the sucess. Overall, there seems to be a correlation betweek the success and failure. On months where the success rate is high, so is the failure rate(but always about 50% lower than the success).
    In the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet, one of the first things we notice is that with lower goals, we have much more projects that have been successful or failed. We see that there is almost an equal amount of of success and failure when the goal is between $19,999 and $20,000. There are three points in this graph where the success and failure overlap. those are roughtly at $20,000, $35,000 and $45,000. The overall finding is that with smalelr budgets, there is a higher likelyhood of success. Plays that were below $20,000 all had a higher success rate than those above. 
    I think some of the limitations were that there was a lot of categories to chose from. The data wasn't large enough to reflect 99% accuracy. For instance, the ranges using for the Goals sheet were too large. If they had been smaller and between 1-1000, there would be more data points and greater accuracy. In the Outocmes Based on Launch Date, I think it would be more useful and accurate if there was an extra filter telling us why the theater succeeded of failed.
    We could also create clustered columns that would show succeeded/failed/canceled plays by month next to each other. This way we could have a better visual of the percentages than we did with the line graph used. The same type of chart would be useful for the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" data. This was we would see easily what months we have higher rates of success, failure and cancelations. Another table we can create would be all the failed outcomes. We can filter through and see what category has the most failures and which country that is. The analysis was very interesting and the conclusions helped understand the data better.
